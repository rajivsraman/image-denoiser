# AIPI 590 (Applied Computer Vision) - Project 3
### Author: Rajiv Raman

## Overview

We were given two options for this project, and I chose to pursue Project 3B: building an image-denoising algorithm based on a generative adversarial network (GAN).

All data was collected from the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD), which can be found here: https://abdokamel.github.io/sidd/.

In particular, a smaller subset of SIDD images (140 images) was used for model training, and only 20 images were used for testing. All of this data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajat95gupta/smartphone-image-denoising-dataset.
